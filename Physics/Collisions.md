There are two types of collision, elastic and inelastic. Though elastic comes up in A level physics often, it is actually almost impossible to create a perfect elastic collision. Generally, all collisions release some energy in the form of heat or sound.

## Elastic collisions
In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy is conserved, so when calculating such things, the kinetic energy input needs to equal the kinetic energy output as well as the momentums of the two objects needs to add to the momentum of the object that started the collision.

## Inelastic Collisions
In an inelastic collision, **only** momentum is conserved. This means that the sums of the momentums of the objects after the collisions is equal to the sums of momentums before the collisions.
