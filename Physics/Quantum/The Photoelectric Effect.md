The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon that when light is shined on to a metal surface, electrons are ejected from the metal. This provides important evidence that light is '*quantised*', or carried in discrete packets.

### The laws of the photoelectric effect
1. Electrons are only emitted if  the *frequency* of the light is above a certain threshold frequency
2. If the frequency is high enough, the *intensity* of the light governs how many electrons are emitted.
3. The *maximum kinetic energy* of emitted electrons is independent of the intensity of the light, rather it is proportional to the frequency of the light.

### Experimental proof of the photoelectric effect
If the cap of a gold leaf electroscope is connected to a Van de-Graff generator, the whole rod and leaf become negatively charged, thus the gold leaf and brass plate repel each other.
If light of a specific frequency is shined onto the cap, electrons are released from the apparatus. This makes the whole thing less charged, and the gold leaf is repelled less from the plate. If the frequency of the light is reduced, a threshold frequency below which there is no effect can be observed.  
If the metal of the cap is changed, then the threshold frequency is changed, with more reactive metals having a lower threshold frequency.
