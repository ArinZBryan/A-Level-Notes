## The Equations
$E = hf$ (Energy = Planck Constant * frequency)  
$E = \phi + E_{kmax}$ (Energy = Work Function + Maximum kinetic energy)  
$hf = \phi + E_{kmax}$ (Planck Constant * frequency = Work Function + Maximum kinetic energy)  
$\lambda_{dB} = \frac{h}{\rho}$ (De Broglie Wavelength = Planck Constant / Momentum)

## Wave-Particle Duality
It can be shown that light-waves can behave as particles, and particles can exhibit the properties of waves. 

In particular, light interacts with matter in a manner more akin to a particle than a wave. Instead of transferring energy gradually 

## De Broglie Wavelength
The "de Broglie wavelength" of a particle indicates the scale at which said particle will exhibit wave-like properties. This length, often notated as $\lambda_{dB}$ or more simply as just $\lambda$ allows for the calculation of the scales on which wave-effects such as diffraction should be expected for a given particle. It is important to be able to use the equation for de Broglie wavelength in an exam, and to rearrange it and combine it with the equation for kinetic energy. This results in the following equation:

$$\lambda_{dB} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mE_k}}$$

Where:
- $\lambda_{dB}$ is the de Broglie wavelength of the particle
- $h$ is Planck's Constant
- $E_k$ is the kinetic energy of the particle
- $m$ is the mass of the particle
