Gas pressure is caused by particles hitting the side of a container. Anything we can do that increases those collisions will increase the pressure:
- Decreasing the volume of the container
- Increasing the temperature of the gas
### Boyle's Law
"For a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature ("isothermal"), the product of the pressure and the volume is constant."
This can be expressed using the following equation:
$$P_{initial}V_{initial} = P_{final}V_{final}$$
### Gay Lussac's Law
The pressure of  a given amount of gas held at a constant volume is directly proportional to the kelvin temperature.
- If you heat a gas, you give the molecules more energy, so they move faster.
- This means more impacts on the walls of the container and an increase in the pressure.
### Jacques Charles' Law
For a constant mass of gas at a fixed pressure, the volume occupied by the gas is proportional to its absolute temperature (temperature in kelvin)
### Pressure Law
"For a fixed mass of gas at a constant volume, the pressure is directly proportional to the **absolute** temperature."
### A Combined Equation
By combining Boyle's law, the pressure law and Charles' law: we get the equation:
$$\frac{Pressure\space\times\space Volume}{Temperature} = Constant$$
$$\therefore \frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$$
