### Black Body Radiation Curves
When heating an object to a given temperature, the body emits electromagnetic radiation. The graph of the intensities are shown below for some temperatures.

> The unit used on the $x$-axis here, angstroms, is equal to one tenth of a nanometre. Thus, to get the value in $\text{nm}$, just divide by 10.

> When attempting to sketch black body curves, ensure that the lines never cross at either end. Also ensure that they do not appear asymptotic on the left hand side. The lines should not be asymptotic. Also, the colours used here are *really* not respective of the colours of light emitted (Red should be coldest, and blue should be hottest). 

### $\lambda_{max}$
The peaks of these curves have a wavelength of $\lambda_{max}$ . Make sure that $\lambda_{max}$ always means the wavelength of maximum intensity, and not the maximum wavelength of radiation emitted. This would not make sense, and thus is never used.

There is also a formula for the wavelength of peak intensity ($T$ is temperature):
$$\lambda_{max} T = 2.898\times 10^{-3}\text{mK}$$
> Note that the unit $mK$ is *not* millikelvins. It is actually meter-kelvins.

This equation is called *Wien's Law*, and can be found in the formula booklet.
### Stefan-Boltzmann Law
$$L = \sigma AT^4$$
$$L = \sigma4\pi r^2T^4$$

>$L$, Luminosity in $W$
>$A$, Area in square $m^2$
>$T$, Temperature in $K$ 
>$r$, Radius in $\text{m}$
>$\sigma$, Stefan-Boltzmann constant, in $\text{Wm}^{-2}\text{K}^{-4}$  ($5.67\times 10^-8\space\text{Wm}^{-2}\text{K}^{-4}$)

### Luminosity from a point source
$$I = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}$$
>$I$, Intensity across all wavelengths in $Wm^2$
>$d$, Distance from the point source in $m$
>$L$, Luminosity in $W$

Thus, we can combine the equations:
$$Id^2 = \sigma r^2T^4$$
>$T$, Surface temperature of the star in $K$ 
>$r$, Radius of the star in $\text{m}$
>$\sigma$, Stefan-Boltzmann Constant, in $\text{Wm}^{-2}\text{K}^{-4}$  ($5.67\times 10^-8\space\text{Wm}^{-2}\text{K}^{-4}$)
>$I$, Intensity across all wavelengths in $Wm^2$
>$d$, Distance from the star in $m$
