If an ideal gas, for example: neon, is heated, the heat energy is converted to a kinetic energy in the particles, where:
$$E_k = \frac 32nRT$$
So if the temperature is increased from $T_1$ to $T_2$ (equivalent to $\Delta T$), the energy required for that temperature change is:
$$E_{required} = \frac 32nR(T_2 - T_1)$$
Rearranging this, we can find the *energy per mole per degree kelvin* for an ideal gas to be:
$$\frac{E_{required}}{n} = C_v = \frac 32x\cdot 8.314 = 12.47...$$
Strangely, for ideal (monoatomic gasses) we find that $C_v$ is a constant for all of these gasses.

| Ideal Gas    | $C_v$ - $JK^{-1}mol^{-1}$ |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Neon ($Ne$)    | 12.47                     |
| Argon ($Ar$)   | 12.47                     |
| Mercury ($Hg$) | 12.47                     |
| Sodium ($Na$)  | 12.47                     |

Non-ideal gasses, don't conform in quite the same way:

| Diatomic Gas      | $C_v$ - $JK^{-1}mol^{-1}$ |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Nitrogen ($N_2$)  | 20.81                     |
| Oxygen ($O_2$)    | 21.06                     |
| Chlorine ($Cl_2$) | 25.62                          |

| Triatomic Gas           | $C_v$ - $JK^{-1}mol^{-1}$ |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$) | 28.81                     |
| Nitrous Oxide ($N_2O$)  | 30.50                     |
| Sulfur Dioxide ($SO_2$) | 31.56                     | 

## Specific Heat Capacity
*Specific heat capacity* can be thought of as "*the capacity of an object to store heat*" - If we heat up a beaker of water, it's obvious that the energy it gains is proportional to the amount of water and how hot it gets.
$$Energy = SHC\cdot Mass\cdot Temperature\space Change$$
$$E = mc\Delta T$$
More specifically, *specific heat capacity* is defined as:
- The energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogramme of a substance by one Kelvin.
- Measured in $Jkg^-1K^-1$ or $Jkg^-1^\circ C^-1$
Even more accurately, the *specific* heat capacity is property of a substance, i.e. a value per unit mass of the substance, where as heat capacity is a value for a given object.
## Specific Latent Heat
The latent heat of a substance is the energy required to change the state of the substance. Generally, there are two specific latent heats, the *specific latent heat of vaporisation*, used for the boiling / condensing phase transition and *the specific latent heat of fusion*, which is used for the freezing / melting phase transition.

Whilst a substance changes is changing state, its temperature does not change. The energy supplied during this period of time to change the state of the matter is called a *latent heat*.

Latent heat is measured in Joules per kilogram ($Jkg^{-1}$), and is calculated via the following:
$Energy = Mass\cdot SLH$
