An *ideal gas* is one that obeys [Boyle's Law](./Thermal%20Gas%20Laws.md) under all conditions. In reality, however, no real gas is an ideal gas under all conditions.
Under conditions of low pressure / high temperature, real gases will obey Boyle's law and are said to be behaving in an ideal manner.
At high temperatures / low volumes or at temperatures near the gas's boiling point, real gases stop behaving ideally and no longer follow Boyle's law.
This is because the gas's molecules/atoms are occupying a significant proportion of the volume.
### Assumptions of ideal gasses
1. All molecules of a particular gas are identical
2. The internal energy of the gas is entirely kinetic
3. All collisions between molecules and the walls of the container are completely elastic.
4. Newton's laws of motion apply
5. Molecules take up negligible volume
6. Gravitational and electrostatic forces can be ignored
7. The motion of all molecules is random
8. All molecules travel in straight lines.
### Avogadro's Law
Avogadro's law states that equal volumes of different gases at the same pressure and temperature will contain equal numbers of particles.
### Molar Volume of Gases
If the temperature and pressure (273K and 100kPa), 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of $2.27\times 10^{-2}$m^3. This is the molar volume.

### Ideal Gas Equation
In [Thermal Gas Laws](./Thermal%20Gas%20Laws.md), we derived the *ideal gas equation*. We can now combine this with Avogadro's law: $V \propto n$, so the equation can be written as:
$$pV = nRT$$
- $p$ = Pressure of the gas
- $V$ = volume of the gas
- $n$ = number of moles of the gas
- $R$ = Molar gas constant (8.31 Jmol^-1 K^-1)
- $T$ = absolute temperature of the gas
