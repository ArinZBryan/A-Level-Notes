An *ideal gas* is one that obeys [Boyle's Law](./Thermal%20Gas%20Laws.md) under all conditions. In reality, however, no real gas is an ideal gas under all conditions.
Under conditions of low pressure / high temperature, real gases will obey Boyle's law and are said to be behaving in an ideal manner.
At high temperatures / low volumes or at temperatures near the gas's boiling point, real gases stop behaving ideally and no longer follow Boyle's law.
This is because the gas's molecules/atoms are occupying a significant proportion of the volume.
### Assumptions of ideal gasses
1. All molecules of a particular gas are identical
2. The internal energy of the gas is entirely kinetic
3. All collisions between molecules and the walls of the container are completely elastic.
4. Newton's laws of motion apply
5. Molecules take up negligible volume
6. Gravitational and electrostatic forces can be ignored
7. The motion of all molecules is random
8. All molecules travel in straight lines.
### Avogadro's Law
Avogadro's law states that equal volumes of different gases at the same pressure and temperature will contain equal numbers of particles.
### Molar Volume of Gases
If the temperature and pressure (273K and 101kPa), 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of $2.27\times 10^{-2}$m^3. This is the molar volume.
### Ideal Gas Equation
In [Thermal Gas Laws](./Thermal%20Gas%20Laws.md), we looked at the laws that make up the *Ideal Gas Equation*. They can be combined into the equation shown below:
$$pV = nRT$$
- $p$ = Pressure of the gas
- $V$ = volume of the gas
- $n$ = number of moles of the gas
- $R$ = Molar gas constant (8.31 Jmol^-1 K^-1)
- $T$ = absolute temperature of the gas
There is however, a second form of the ideal gas equation that looks very similar:
$$pV = NkT$$
The differences here is that $N$ is not the number of moles of gas, but rather the number of molecules, and that $k$ is the *Boltzmann Constant* (provided on formula sheet).

### Atmospheric pressure
The value for atmospheric pressure at ~sea level is $1.01\times 10^5$ Pa (101KPa). This value is not found in the formula booklet, and as such, is generally supplied by the question. However, this is not always the case, and so it is a good idea to memorise this value.
