### Internal Energy
The internal energy of a substance is the sum of the molecular kinetic and potential energies. Consider a particle, it can store energy in several ways:
- Moving in three dimensions
- Vibrating
- Rotating
These are called *degrees of freedom*, and each can store energy.

### RMS
RMS stands for *root mean square* and the RMS of a set of data is calculated as follows:
$$RMS = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x^2)}{n}}$$
Or in other words, the RMS is equal to the square root of the mean of the data squared.

### Kinetic Theory of Gases
Consider a box of dimensions $x$, $y$ and $z$:
![[Box.svg]]
1. A gas molecule, of mass $m$ is bouncing off the walls. If it hits the wall at a speed of $u$ and collides elastically then it will rebound with a speed of $u$. So, *change in momentum = $+mu-(-mu) = 2mu$*
2. The molecule travels a distance $2x$ before colliding with the same face again, so: *Time between collisions* $=\frac{Distance}{Speed} = \frac{2x}{u}$
3. But force = rate of change in momentum, so: $Force = \frac{2mu}{2\frac{x}{u}} = \frac{mu^2}{x}$
4. However, $Pressure = \frac{force}{area}$, so: $Pressure = \frac{\frac{mu^2}{x}}{yz} = \frac{mu^2}{xyz}$
5. but $xyz$ is the volume of the box, so: Pressure = $\frac{mu^2}{V}$
6. Now we need to consider the whole box. In the whole box, there are N molecules and, on average, a third of them are striking each pair of faces. The average (RMS) speed of the molecules is ${c_{RMS}}^2$ , so:
7. Total Pressure $p = \frac{\frac{1}{3}NMc{_{RMS}}^2}{V}$
