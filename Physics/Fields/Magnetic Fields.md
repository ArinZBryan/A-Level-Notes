A region of space where a charged particle in motion experiences a force which depends on:
- $F = BIl\sin\theta$, where:
	- $F$ is the force on the conductor (Newtons)
	- $B$ is the magnetic flux density (Tesla)
	- $I$ is the current (Amperes)
	- $l$ is the length of the conductor in the field (Metres)
	- $\theta$ is the angle between the conductor and external flux lines. (Degrees / Radians)
- $F = \frac{BQV}{\sin\theta}$, where:
	- $F$ is the force on the charge (Newtons)
	- $B$ is the magnetic flux density (Tesla)
	- $Q$ is the charge on the object (Coulombs)
	- $V$ is the velocity of the charge through the field (Metres per Second)
	-  $\theta$ is the angle between the conductor and external flux lines. (Degrees / Radians)
In plain English, this translates to the following:
	A region of space where the force on a charged particle in motion

### Flux
B = F/IL
= Newton / Amp Metre
= Kgms^-2 A^-1 m^1
= Kgs^-2A^-1
= Kgs^-2(CS^-1)
