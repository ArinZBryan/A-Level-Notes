## Fields in general
A field (in physics) is a volume or region in which an object experiences a non-contact force due to some property of that object. 

There are three major fields that we look at in A Level physics
- Magnetic - Current
- Electrical - Charge
- Gravitational - Mass
## Gravitational Fields more specifically
Thus, a gravitational field is a field in which objects are influenced by the gravitational force, or rather the mass of other objects.
##### The strength of a gravitational field
There are multiple ways to express $g$, the strength of a gravitational field. There are two major ways: 
- Meters Per Second ($m\space s^{-2}$)
- Newtons Per Kilogram ($N\space kg^{-1}$)
On Earth, the value in both units of measure is 9.81.

### The Force of a gravitational field
The force of a gravitational field that Newton came up with is as follows:
$F \propto \frac{M\space m}{r^2}$
However, now we have been able to find the proportionality constant. Thus, the equation is now
$F = \frac{G\space M\space m}{r^2}$
