## Fields in general
A field (in physics) is a volume or region in which an object experiences a non-contact force due to some property of that object. 

There are three major fields that we look at in A Level physics
- Magnetic - Current
- Electrical - Charge
- Gravitational - Mass
## Gravitational Fields more specifically
Thus, a gravitational field is a field in which objects are influenced by the gravitational force, or rather the mass of other objects.
##### The strength of a gravitational field
There are multiple ways to express $g$, the strength of a gravitational field. There are two major ways: 
- Meters Per Second ($m\space s^{-2}$)
- Newtons Per Kilogram ($N\space kg^{-1}$)
On Earth, the value in both units of measure is 9.81.
To calculate $g$, we can use the following equations: 
$g = \frac{V_{grav}}{m} = \frac{GM}{r^2}$

It is important to note that to get out of the area of influence of the gravitational field of an object, you must be infinitely far away from said object. Thus, it can be said that $g$ and $V_{grav}$ can only be zero in the limit, as distance approaches infinity. 
### The Force of a gravitational field
The force of a gravitational field that Newton came up with is as follows:
$F \propto \frac{M\space m}{r^2}$
However, now we have been able to find the proportionality constant. Thus, the equation is now: $F = \frac{G\space M\space m}{r^2}$, where $G = 6.67\times 10^{-11}$.

### Gravitational Potential Energy
Gravitational potential, notated as $V_{grav}$ is equal to the gravitational potential energy per unit mass.

$V_{grav} = \frac EM = \frac{-GM}{r}$
$\text{GPE} = \frac {Em}{M} = \frac{-GMm}{r}$
### Orbiting Bodies

For an object moving in a circle, the resultant force on it is the centripetal force, given by:
(1) $F = \frac{mv^2}{r}$ [(From Circular Motion)](Circular%20Motion.md)
The centripetal force is provided by the gravitational attraction of $M$ on $m$. 
(2) $F_{grav} = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$
$\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$
$v^2r = GM$
$M = \frac{v^2r}{G}$
#### Orbital Period
The period of the satelliteâ€™s orbit, T, is the time it takes for the satellite to make one complete circuit.
$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$ [(From Circular Motion)](Circular%20Motion.md)
$\frac{GM}{r} = v^2$
$\frac{GM}{r} = (\frac{2\pi r}{T})^2$
$\frac{GM}{r} = \frac{4\pi^2r^2}{T^2}$
$GMT^2 = 4\pi^2r^3$
$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2r^3}{GM}$
$T = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi^2r^3}{GM}}$

#### Escape Velocity (Speed)
Escape velocity is the speed you need to be travelling to exit the gravitational influence of  a planet, so long as you are not travelling into it. (Tangent to it works as well)
To calculate the escape velocity from a distance $r$ from a mass $M$, follow the following steps:
1. $\frac12 mV^2 = \frac{GMm}{r}$
2. $\frac 12 V^2 = \frac {GM}{r}$
3. Solve for $V$
> Note: Escape velocity squared is equal to twice the orbit velocity squared.
