### Cathode Ray Tubes
In a cathode ray tube, electrons are accelerated, over a few thousand volts via the use of an electric field. The cathode (negative terminal) is heated to allow for thermionic emission. This is where, by heating up the metal, it 'boils off' electrons, which are then accelerated by the electric field between the cathode and the anode, which is generally tubular in shape. As the electrons follow the electric field to the end, they are eventually 'shot' out the end. In CRT monitors, the stream of electrons is then focussed, and directed by using electromagnets to deflect the stream

### LINACs
A LINear ACcelerator is a device used for accelerating any charged particles up to high, even relativistic speeds. Commonly, a CRT is hooked up to the start of such a particle accelerator, as it is an easy to use source of charged particles.
A LINAC is made from a series of conductive tubes or coils each getting longer in a line. After some point however, they will usually become constant, or near-constant. Each of these tubes/coils is then connected to a high frequency (100KHz - 10MHz), high voltage (> 100KV - > 1MV) AC source.  As the voltage approaches the hundreds of kilovolts, the particles are travelling at significant fraction of the speed of light. When approaching the megavolt range, the particles are generally travelling at almost the speed of light.

In a LINAC, the frequency of the AC must be tuned such that if the charge is positive when the particles enter one of the tubes, it must be negative by the time the particles exit the end of the tube. By doing this, the particles are repelled by the tube they just left, and attracted by the tube they enter next.

### Cyclotrons
A cyclotron is made of two hollow conductive semi-circles, called *dees*. Protons are injected at the centre of the dees. The electric field between the dees will the accelerate the particles as they cross it, and a magnetic field, perpendicular to the whole setup causes the electrons to
