#### What *is* an electric field?
The charge on an object is what causes an object to experience an electric field.

$F = EQ$
Therefore: $E = \frac FQ$, where $E$ is the electric potential.
so, $E$ is in the units Newtons/Coulomb. Note that this is also equal to Volts/Meter. Thus, you will see both come up.
##### Finding E
For a uniform field (between plates), then there is a way of finding $E$. This is done using the equation: $E = \frac VD$. 
To derive this equation: 
$F = EQ$
$W = FD = QV$
$QV = EQD$
$\frac VD = E$
### The shape of fields

In electric fields, there is one part that is quite counter-intuitive:
For two charges that are repelling each other, electric potential decreases as they get further away, whereas if they are attracted, the electric potential increases as the distance does.

This can be easily explained though. Think about the kinetic energy that could be gained or lost when placing these particles near or far: 
- For the attractive particles, placing them near means they can't accelerate towards each other for long until colliding, whereas at larger distances, the potential kinetic energy that can be gained is larger (a longer acceleration time)
- For the repelling particles, placing them near means that the high forces exerted on one another when close mean that they can accelerate lots, thus, there is a high potential energy. On the flipside, when placed apart, the forces between them are minute, and so only a small acceleration is possible. This translates into a low potential,
### Coulomb's Law
![Coulomb's Law Diagram](/Physics/Images/CoulombsLawDiagram.png)

$F_E = \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$
where: 
$F_E$ = Electrostatic force between two charges
$Q_1$ = Charge on point charge 1
$Q_2$ = Charge on point charge 2
$\epsilon_0$ = Permittivity of free space
$r$ = distance between charges

> Note that this equation only works for **point charges** and **not plates**. To make this work for non-point charges, you must do some calculus beyond A-Level.

> Note that $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are also vectors, and it matters whether they are positive or negative

> This equation may also be stated as $k\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$, where $k$ is just all the constants factored out. This constant is found in the formula book.
### Electric Potential Energy
Electric potential energy can be calculated in several ways:
$W = \frac{Q_1Q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}$ (notated as $k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r}$, where $k$ is in the formula book.)
or,
$W = EQ$
> Note that the first can only be used between two point-charges and the second only for charges in uniform fields.

As the first equation looks a lot like coulomb's law, it is important to ensure that you remember **not** to square $r$.
