#### What *is* an electric field?
The charge on an object is what causes an object to experience an electric field.

$F = EQ$
Therefore: $E = \frac FQ$
so, $E$ is in the units Newtons/Coulomb. Note that this is also equal to Volts/Meter. Thus, you will see both come up.
##### Finding E
For a uniform field (between plates), then there is a way of finding $E$. This is done using the equation: $E = \frac VD$. 
To derive this equation: 
$F = EQ$
$W = FD = QV$
$QV = EQD$
$\frac VD = E$

### Coulomb's Law

$F_E = \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$
where: 
$F_E$ = Electrostatic force between two charges
$Q_1$ = Charge on point charge 1
$Q_2$ = Charge on point charge 2
$\epsilon_0$ = Permittivity of free space
$r$ = distance between charges

> Note that this equation only works for **point charges** and **not plates**. To make this work for non-point charges, you must do some calculus beyond A-Level.

> Note that $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are also vectors, and it matters whether they are positive or negative
