#### Field lines:
- In a uniform field they are parallel and evenly spaced.
- In any field the closer the lines are together, the stronger the field
#### Equipotential Lines:
- All points on an equipotential line have the same field strength.
- Always perpendicular to the field lines
- Closer together when the field is stronger
- Parallel and evenly spaced in a uniform field.
