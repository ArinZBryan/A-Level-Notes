## Stress and Strain
If an object is being stretched, with a force applied on both ends, then the strain within the object is equal to the force applied on the object to stretch it, and the cross-sectional area of the object being stretched, perpendicular to the direction of stretching. Strain on the other hand, is the ratio of the change in object's length to the original length.
Note, as strain is calculated by dividing one length by another, it is unitless, and as such should just be represented by a number.
### Formulas
$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$ (stress)
$\epsilon = \frac{\Delta l}{l_0}$ (strain)
## Young's Modulus
The young's modulus of an object is just  the stress in that object over the strain on the object. In effect, it measures the stiffness of a material. Young's modulus is measured in Pascals.
## Stress / Strain Graphs
![An Example Stress / Strain Graph](StressStrainGraph.jpg)
The above stress/strain graph shows an example for a strong material. Before the *limit of proportionality*, the young's modulus can be used, and Hooke's Law Applies. After this, but before the Yield Strength, the material is still undergoing elastic deformation. I.e.. It will return to its original shape. After this, the material will undergo plastic deformation, where the structure of molecules within the material is fundamentally changing, resulting in the change of shape that is found in this type of deformation.
## Hooke's Law
Hooke's Law ($F = kx$, where $F$ = Force applied, $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is is the extension) is a law governing how springs work, and incidentally also applies whenever any object is being stretched, not just springs. Note: for springs in series, the sum of the reciprocal of their spring constants equals the spring constant of the system. With springs in parallel, the spring constants add to make the spring constant of the system.
