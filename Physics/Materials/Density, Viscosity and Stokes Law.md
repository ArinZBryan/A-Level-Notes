## Density
Density is equal to mass per unit volume, and is measured in $\text{kgm}^{-3}$ or ${gcm}^{-3}$, with the conversion factor being to multiply by 100 to get from $\text{kgm}^{-3}$ to $\text{gcm}^{-3}$

## Stokes' Law, Viscous Drag
Viscous drag is the force between a fluid an an object moving through it that opposes the motion of the object.

This is calculated using stokes' Law:

$$F = 6\pi\eta r v$$

where: $F$ is the force of drag, $\eta$ is the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid, $r$ is the radius of the object, and $v$ the velocity of the object. 

> **NOTE:** Stokes law only applies if the following conditions are met:
> - The flow around the object is laminar (not turbulent)
> - The object is spherical  

> For the first requirement to be met, the object must also be small and travel at a relatively slow speed.

### Viscosity
The coefficient of viscosity, $\eta$ can be thought of as just the viscosity of the fluid (at a particular temperature). This term is equal to the 'thickness' of the fluid, or how easily it flows. In fact, the flow rate of the fluid is inversely proportional to the fluid's coefficient of viscosity. It is important to note that substances in different states of matter change their viscosity in different ways in different states. For example, liquids become less viscous when heated, but gasses become more viscous.

### Terminal Velocity
When an object is at terminal velocity, $U_{pthrust} + V_{iscous drag} = W_{eight}$. Thus, this can be combined with Stokes' law easily, as the weight can be easily measured, and the upthrust calculated without too much trouble.

### Types of flow
There are only two types of flow that need to be paid attention to at A Level. These are laminar and turbulent. These types of flow are differentiated by one fact. In laminar flow, different 'layers' of the fluid do not mix, whereas, in turbulent flow, they do.
