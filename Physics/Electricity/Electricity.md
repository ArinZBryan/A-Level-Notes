## The Basics
Current (I) - The flow of charge per unit time, also known as the rate of flow of charge
- $I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$
- Measured in Amperes (A)

Potential Difference (V) - The energy transferred per unit charge, between two points in a circuit.
- $V = \frac{E}{Q}$
- Measured in Volts (V)

Resistance (R) - A measure of how '*difficult*' for charge carriers / current to pass through some section of circuit. Equal to the potential difference over that section divided by the current in the section. 
- $R = \frac{V}{I}$
- Measured in Ohms ($\Omega$)

## Power
**Electrical power** has several ways of being calculated:

$P = IV$ , $P = \frac{V^2}{R}$ and $P = I^2R$

As **power** is also equal to energy transferred over time, this can be used to find the energy transferred by a circuit in a given time.

## Kirchhoff's Laws
1. The total current flowing into a junction is equal to the current flowing out of that junction
	- This just means that no charge is lost at any point in the circuit
2. The sum of all voltages in a series circuit is equal to the supply voltage
	- This, combined with the previous law, shows that no energy is lost at any point within a circuit.

## Potential Dividers
A **potential divider** is a circuit with several resistors in series connected across a source voltage. By connecting leads to only one of the resistors, a lower voltage can be obtained, based on the resistances of the two resistors. It is not uncommon to see a thermistor, LDR or potentiometer placed as one of the resistors to allow for a variable voltage to be output. This is useful for automation events, like turning on a light or heater.
