### Fleming's Right Hand Rule
When a conductive wire is moved through a magnetic field, a current is induced in the wire. The direction of the current is given by Fleming’s right-hand rule for generators. As with Fleming’s left-hand rule, the thumb is the direction of the motion of the wire, or equivalently, the force exerted on the wire, F, the first finger is the direction of the magnetic field, B, and the second finger is the direction of the induced conventional current, I.

## Lenz's Law
Consider the following scenario:
![[Lenzs_Law_1.svg]]
This scenario will induce a force in the opposite direction via the motor effect ([Fleming's Left Hand Rule](Physics/Fields/Magnetic%20Fields)).
![[Lenzs_Law_2.svg]]
As it happens, the effect will be the same if we start with Fleming's Left Hand Rule, and find Fleming's Right Hand Rule creating the same scenario.

This leads to Lenz's Law:
	**The current induced in a wire due to electromagnetic induction will oppose the change that created it.**
In other words: the force moving a charge through the electromagnetic field will be opposed by the force created via the induced current.

Lenz's law is, despite it's seemingly complex wording, actually just an extension of conservation of energy: if the converse were true, an object would accelerate up to high speeds just by being lightly pushed into a magnetic field.

This can be shown by just dropping a magnet through a copper pipe: the magnet falls much slower than it would falling down a plastic pipe. This is due to the force acting against gravity, caused by Lenz's Law.
