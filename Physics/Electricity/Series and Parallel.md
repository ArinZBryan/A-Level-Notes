### Resistance
In series, resistance adds, so: $R_T = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots + R_n$

In parallel however, the reciprocal of total resistance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the resistance of the branches. 

$\frac{1}{R_T} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \dots + \frac{1}{R_n}$

### Current
In a series circuit, current is the same all across the circuit.

In a parallel circuit, the sum of the currents in each parallel set of branches is equal to the total current.

### Potential Difference
In a series circuit, the supply voltage is equal to the sum of the voltages across each component.

In a parallel circuit, the potential difference across each branch is the same.

It is important to note that when connecting identical cells in parallel, that the voltages do not add, whereas they do if joined in series.

### Capacitance
In a series circuit, capacitance is the reciprocal of the sums of reciprocals of capacitances:
$\frac 1C = \frac {1}{C_1} + \frac {1}{C_2} + \frac {1}{C_3} + \dots + \frac {1}{C_n}$ 
In a parallel circuit, capacitances add across all branches.
