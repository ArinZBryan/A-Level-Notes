**Ohm's Law** ($V = IR$) states that for an *ohmic conductor*, *current* is directly proportional to the *voltage* across it, as long as physical conditions are kept the same.

Below are some I/V graphs of common conductors that are needed at A-Level

### Ohmic Conductor
This type of component follows **Ohm's Law**, and so it's graph is a straight line through the origin.

### Diode (Semiconductor)
As a diode only allows current to flow in one direction, it makes sense that little to no current passes until the required threshold voltage is met.

### Filament Lamp
Surprisingly, until a threshold current, this type of conductor obeys **Ohm's Law**, however, as the current increases, and the metal filament heats up, the resistance increases, and thus causes a break from **Ohm's Law**

### Ammeter
Unless stated otherwise in a question, ammeters are assumed to have a resistance of *zero*, meaning their presence cannot affect the value they show. This does not actually apply in the real world though, as nothing is perfect.

### Voltmeter
Unless stated otherwise in a question, voltmeters are assumed to have infinite resistance, and as such, no current can flow through them. This is required to ensure that their reading is completely accurate. This does not actually apply in the real world though, as no part is perfect.

## Resistivity
**Resistivity** (Ohm-Meters / $\Omega M$) is a measure of how easily a material conducts electricity, and is therefore a property of the material in question. It is equal to the product of resistance and cross-sectional area of a piece of the material, divided by the length of the material.
$$\rho = \frac{R A}{L}$$
Note that resistivity is highly dependent on temperature, and the conditions of the material when it is being measured.

### Temperature in relation to resistivity
As the temperature of a conductor increases, the resistance of that conductor will as well. This is because the atoms of the conductor gain kinetic energy, and thus move more, blocking and slowing down electrons flowing through them in the process.

However, this does not seem to apply to all conductors. The biggest place where this does not apply is in a *thermistor*. In fact, in a *thermistor*, the **opposite** happens. As heat increases, the resistance drops instead. In fact, what is happening here, is that in a *thermistor*, as the temperature rises, electrons are **emitted** from the material of the *thermistor*, cancelling out the effect of the resistance increasing due to temperature.

### Superconductors
A **superconductor** is a material which, below a given temperature, known as the *critical temperature*, have **zero resistivity**. This temperature depends on the material the superconductor is made from, but most superconductors have very low critical temperatures, usually not far from absolute zero (-273 $^\circ C$).
### Semiconductors
Semiconductors work by releasing electrons from the lattice of molecules held within under special circumstances. This adds free electrons to the material, so they can flow more freely, reducing resistivity.
This is actually how **NTC thermistors** and **LDRs** work: the heat/light causes charge carriers to be released, which lowers the resistivity of the material, and the resistance of the component.
