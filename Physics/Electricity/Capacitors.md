Capacitors are electrical devices used to store electrical energy in a circuit, for later release. They can be used as short term electrical storage, in a similar manner to a battery, however, they are most commonly used to smooth electrical noise generated by components such as motors, inductors and analogue chips as well as smoothing AC to DC power supplies' outputs (eg. smoothing the output of a *full bridge rectifier*).
Capacitors can be made in several ways, but all are roughly done by placing two charged plates next to each other, with some sort of insulator between them. One is positively charged, and the other is negatively charged. The capacitance effect can be increased by placing a stronger dielectric (insulator) between the plates.

Capacitance = Charge Displaced / Voltage Across Plate
$$C =\frac{Q}{V}$$

The factors affecting capacitance of a capacitor are as follows:
- Plate Area - Greater plate area gives greater capacitance
- Plate Spacing - Closer plate spacing gives greater capacitance
- Dielectric Material - Greater Permittivity of the material leads to greater capacitance
 
### Energy stored in a capacitor
The energy stored in the capacitor is equal to the area under the graph:

Thus, $E = \frac{1}{2}QV$ or $E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2$ or $E = \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}$

### Discharging a capacitor
When charging and discharging a capacitor, the voltage and current across the capacitor follow exponential curves

The equations used here are as follows:
$Q = Q_0\space e^{\frac{-t}{CR}}$
$V = V_0\space e^{\frac{-t}{CR}}$
$I = I_0\space e^{\frac{-t}{CR}}$

Where:
- $Q$ = Charge (Coulombs)
- $Q_0$ = Initial Charge (Coulombs)
- V = Potential Difference Across Capacitor (Volts)
- $V_0$ = Initial Potential Difference Across Capacitor (Volts)
- $I$ = Current (Amperes)
- $I_0$ = Initial Current (Amperes)
- $t$ = Time Discharging (Seconds)
- $C$ = Capacitance (Farads)
- $R$ = Resistance of the components being discharged into (Ohms)
