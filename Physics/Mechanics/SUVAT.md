$s =$ Displacement  
$u =$ Initial Velocity  
$v =$ Final Velocity  
$a =$ Acceleration  
$t =$ Time  

$v = u + at$ (missing $s$)  
$s = vt - \frac{1}{2}at^2$ (missing $u$)  
$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ (missing $v$)  
$s = \frac{1}{2}(v+u)t$ (missing $a$)  
$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$ (missing $t$)  

## Note:
This applies in both 1, 2 and 3D, but in physics, generally, only one dimension is touched at a time.
