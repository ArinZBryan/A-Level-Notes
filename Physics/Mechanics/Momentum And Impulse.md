## Momentum
An object's momentum is given by its velocity times by its mass. This is in effect an object's resistance to stopping moving. As momentum is calculated using velocity, which is a vector, momentum must be a vector.

## Impulse
Impulse is equal to the change in momentum or the force applied to an object times the time.
