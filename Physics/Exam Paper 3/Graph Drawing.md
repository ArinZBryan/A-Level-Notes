When drawing a graph, there are several things to consider:
1. Axes: Labelled with units
2. Scale: $1\times 10^n$, what will $n$ be?
3. Is the zero needed?: The graph should occupy more than half of each axis.
4. What is needed?: Will the gradient be important? What about the $y$-intercept.?
5. Line/Curve of best fit: Equal number of points either side of the line, where points/above below the line should be randomly distributed (no groupings of points above or below)
6. Ink in the points before drawing the line/curve
