*Errors*, also called *Uncertainties* come in two flavours:
- Random
	- Run-to-run variance
- Systematic
	- A consistent mistake or error from the real value (eg. incorrectly zeroing a scale)
*Systematic errors* are errors that should be attempted to be mitigated in the experiment itself. This then should be noted when planning and carrying out experiments.
*Random errors* are errors that cannot be accounted for, and can be due to any number of factors, chief of which being insufficient measuring apparatus.
### Calculating uncertainties
To calculate uncertainties, attempt to try the following in order. If one is not possible, then attempt the next.
##### 1. Range Testing
$\pm$ Half the range
##### 2. Digital Equipment
$\pm$ The least significant figure on the readout
##### 3. Analogue Equipment
$\pm$ Half the most precise figure on the readout
### Absolute vs Relative
An absolute uncertainty is given as the value $\pm$ some value with a unit.
A relative uncertainty is given as the value $\pm$ a percentage of that value without a unit.
> Remember: Uncertainties should not be given to more than 2 significant figures. Most of the time one significant figure is best.

### Propagating Uncertainties
- When adding or subtracting values, add the *absolute* uncertainties
- When multiplying or dividing values, add the *relative* uncertainties
- When raising a value to a power, multiply the *relative* uncertainties by the power
