When a electron, muon or tau particle decays into one of the others, it is important to make sure that both halves of the equation have equal numbers of types.
i.e.
$\mu \rightarrow e + \overline{v_e} + \overline{v_{\mu}}$
has a muon on one side and an anti-muon neutrino on the other, and there is both an electron and anti-electron neutrino to cancel out.
