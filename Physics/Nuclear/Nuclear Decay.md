When a nucleus decays, it may decay in one of several ways:
- $\alpha$ decay, releasing an $\alpha$ particle
	- Releases an alpha particle (2 protons + 2 neutrons)
- $\beta^-$  decay, releasing an electron ($\beta^-$ particle)
	- Turns a neutron into a proton and an electron which is emitted as a beta particle
- $\beta^+$ decay, releasing a positron ($\beta^+$ particle)

### Stable and unstable nuclei
The very lightest nuclei have almost equal numbers of protons and neutrons: they follow the white line from the graph above.
The very heavies nuclei require more neutrons than protons, usually approximately 50% more neutrons than protons.
Most stable nuclei have an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons. This suggests that two neutrons and two protons form a particularly stable combination. This also happens to be the combination of particles that form alpha particles.

When a nucleus is unstable, it will disintegrate by decaying to move closer towards the line of stability. A nuclei above the line will decay via beta-minus down towards it, and one below the line will decay via beta-plus up towards it. If a nucleus is beyond the line entirely, it will undergo alpha decay to move towards it.
