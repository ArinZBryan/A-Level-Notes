Every particle has an **anti-particle** version with the same mass and opposing charge. For example:
- Proton $\rightarrow$ Anti-Proton
- Neutron $\rightarrow$ Anti-Neutron
- Electron $\rightarrow$ Anti-Electron
- Neutrino $\rightarrow$ Anti-Neutrino
### Rest Energy 
Einstein's famous formula, $E = mc^2$, tells us that mass is just a dense form of energy.
If you consider a particle 'at rest', or with no other energies, we can say the mass alone contriutes to the energy of the particle. This then, is the rest mass of the particle.
$$E = m_0c^2$$
> $E$ = Rest Energy, $m_0$ = Rest Mass, $c$ = Speed of Light in a vacuum.

### Annihilation
When a particle meets its equivalent anti-particle, they are both destroyed. In annihilating, both particles masses are converted into energy in the form of two gamma rays (photons).
In this situation, energy is conserved, and so
$$E = m_0c^2 = hf$$
In doing this, we can also observe that momentum is conserved, and the matter : antimatter ratio is also conserved.
When annihilating, the particles doing so will be identical, but also so will the two photons. Thus, the rest energy of the particles will match the *minimum* energy  of the photons. We say the minimum energy, as the particles will likely possess some knietic energy  before annihilation.
$$hf_{min} = E_0$$
### Pair Production
A photon, when interacting with the nucleus, may create a particle-antiparticle pair. Each with half the rest energy of the photon that created them.
$$hf_{min} = 2E_0$$
### Units of Energy
The *electronvolt* is a unit of **energy**, equivalent to the amount of energy transferred to an electron accelerated across a potential difference of 1V.
- 1 eV = $1.6\times 10^{-19}$J
- 1 MeV = $1.6\times 10^{-13}$J
### Units of Mass
As energy and mass are related by Einstein's formula, we can say that the units of mass are realted to the units of energy by dividing by $c^2$.
This provides physicists with a convenient unit to use in calculations when working with particle collisions.
- 1 $MeVc^-2 = 1.6\times10^-30$
- 1 $GeVc^-2 = 1.6\times10^-27$
### Relativistic Effects
Accelerated particles often reach speeds that are close to the speed of light. At such high velocities, *relativistic effects*, such as **time dilation** and **length contraction** begin to have a major effect.
#### Time Dilation
Clocks run more slowly for moving particles
- This means unstable particles, with short lifetimes can actually survive for much longer when moving quickly. This means that the particles will leave longer tracks, which makes the particles easier to detect.
> An Example:
> Muons are created high up in the atmosphere, and have a lifetime of around 2$\mu s$. Yet despite this, they were able to be detected at sea level in large numbers due to time dilation 'slowing down' the time before they were destroyed.

#### Time Dilation Equation
$$t' = \frac{t}{\sqrt{{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}}$$
