### 1803 - Solid Sphere model
- Elements are made of tiny particles called *atoms*
- Atoms of one element are identical while atoms made of different elements are different
- Atoms cannot be destroyed - Conservation of atoms / mass / energy
- Different atoms form compounds in constant ratios.

### 1897 - Discovery of Electron
Whilst studying cathode rays, JJ Thompson discovered particles with a tiny mass, and a negative charge. These particles were given out by atoms, and were measured to be much smaller. These particles were electrons.
> The *solid sphere model* failed to explain the discovery of electrons

### 1904 - Plum Pudding Model
Based on the discovery of the electron, JJ Thompson proposed the *plum pudding model*. In this model, electrons are distributed in a sphere of uniform positive charge. 
This is called the *plum pudding model* because the electrons in the atom were thought to be like raisins in a plum pudding.
### 1911 - Rutherford's Experiment

##### What Happened?
1. Most alpha particles went straight through without any deflection. This was expected.
2. *Some* alpha particles were slightly deflected. This was expected.
3. A *tiny* number of alpha particles were bounced right back. **This was completely unexpected**
As the experiment was carried out in a vacuum, all deflection must have been due to the gold foil.
> The *plum pudding model* did not explain this.
### 1911 - Planetary Model
Following Rutherford's gold foil experiment, a new model was created.
- Atoms have a central, positively charged nucleus containing the majority of the mass
- Electrons orbit the nucleus, in the same fashion planets may orbit a star.
### 1913 - Bohr Nuclear Model
Niels Bohr showed that electrons occupy 'shells' or 'energy levels'. These shells formed concentric rings around the nucleus at specific distances from the nucleus.
Bohr hypothesised that the electrons orbited the nucleus in quantised orbits.
Charged particles, such as electrons and protons, create electromagnetic fields as they move, and that these fields transport energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.
> The *planetary model* did not allow for energy levels.

### 1919 - Discovery of Proton
