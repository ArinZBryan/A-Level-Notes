### 1803 - Solid Sphere model
- Elements are made of tiny particles called *atoms*
- Atoms of one element are identical while atoms made of different elements are different
- Atoms cannot be destroyed - Conservation of atoms / mass / energy
- Different atoms form compounds in constant ratios.

### 1897 - Discovery of Electron
Whilst studying cathode rays, JJ Thompson discovered particles with a tiny mass, and a negative charge. These particles were given out by atoms, and were measured to be much smaller. These particles were electrons.
> The *solid sphere model* failed to explain the discovery of electrons

### 1904 - Plum Pudding Model
Based on the discovery of the electron, JJ Thompson proposed the *plum pudding model*. In this model, electrons are distributed in a sphere of uniform positive charge. 
This is called the *plum pudding model* because the electrons in the atom were thought to be like raisins in a plum pudding.
### 1911 - Rutherford's Experiment

##### What Happened?
1. Most alpha particles went straight through without any deflection. This was expected.
2. *Some* alpha particles were slightly deflected. This was expected.
3. A *tiny* number of alpha particles were bounced right back. **This was completely unexpected**
As the experiment was carried out in a vacuum, all deflection must have been due to the gold foil.
> The *plum pudding model* did not explain this.
### 1911 - Planetary Model
Following Rutherford's gold foil experiment, a new model was created.
- Atoms have a central, positively charged nucleus containing the majority of the mass
- Electrons orbit the nucleus, in the same fashion planets may orbit a star.
### 1913 - Bohr Nuclear Model
Niels Bohr showed that electrons occupy 'shells' or 'energy levels'. These shells formed concentric rings around the nucleus at specific distances from the nucleus.
Bohr hypothesised that the electrons orbited the nucleus in quantised orbits.
Charged particles, such as electrons and protons, create electromagnetic fields as they move, and that these fields transport energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.
> The *planetary model* did not allow for energy levels.

### 1919 - Discovery of Proton
Rutherford found that when nitrogen nuclei ejected something similar to a *hydrogen atom*, when bombarded with alpha particles. This particle was subsequently called the proton.
### 1926 - Schrödinger's Quantum Model
> Moving electrons should emit energy and collapse into the nucleus

Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles should be treated as waves with a wavelength of $\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$.
Erwin Schrödinger proposed the quantum mechanical model of the atom, which treats electrons as waves. By doing this, we can calculate the probability of an electron being in any given position. This model describes the nucleus as being surrounded by a cloud of electrons, where density relates to the probability of finding an electron there.

>Atomic disintegration showed that the atomic number was less than the atomic mass, so the proton could not be the only particle in the nucleus.
>One leading theory was the presence of electrons in the nucleus, but there was also the possibility of particles with no charge.

### 1932 - Chadwick discovers the neutron
Chadwick bombarded beryllium with alpha particles, and observed an unknown radiation powerful enough to eject protons from various nuclei.
Gamma rays could not be powerful enough, so the radiation must be from a newly discovered neutral particle (the neutron).
