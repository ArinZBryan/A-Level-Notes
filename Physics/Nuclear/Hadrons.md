Quarks and antiquarks cannot exist alone. They always bind together to form some sort of **hadron**. This can be done in two ways, either by combining a quark and an antiquark (obviously not the antimatter version of the quark) to produce a **meson**, or by combining three quarks / antiquarks together to make **baryons**.

### Baryons
Any three quarks combining into a *baryon* must have charges that add to an integer value. Thus, there is no baryon with a non-whole charge.
Examples of *baryons* are as follows:
- Proton $(p)$  = Up, Up, Down
- Neutron $(n)$ = Up, Down, Down
- Antiproton $(\overline p)$ = Anti-Up, Anti-Up, Anti-Down
- Antineutron $(\overline n)$ = Anti-Up, Anti-Down, Anti-Down
- Sigma Plus $(\Sigma^+)$ = Up, Up, Strange
- Sigma Zero $(\Sigma^0)$ = Up, Down, Strange
- Sigma Minus $(\Sigma^-)$ = Down, Down, Strange
> The list above is absolutely **not exhaustive**, these are only the ones needed at A-Level (I think). A full list of baryons can be found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_baryons). There are also *baryons* with the symbols $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, $\Omega$ and $\Delta$  
##### Baryon Number
All *baryons* have a property called their *baryon number*. All *baryons* have a *baryon number* of $+1$, *antibaryons* have a baryon number of $-1$.
From this, we can surmise that *quarks* have a *baryon number* of $+\frac{1}{3}$, all *antiquarks* have a *baryon number* of $-\frac{1}{3}$ and leptons have a *baryon number* of $0$.

Whenever a reaction involving *baryons* occurs, the **sum of baryon numbers is conserved**. 
For instance, in $\beta^-$ decay: $n \rightarrow p + e^- +\overline{v_e}$ . Examples of reactions are the decay of *baryons* into other *baryons*, as well as particle-antiparticle pairs annihilating.

| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

| Strangeness ($S$)   | $0$          | $0$         | $-1$          | $0$                     | $0$                       | $1$                          |
| Baryon Number ($B$) | $+\frac 13$  | $+\frac 13$ | $\frac 13$    | $-\frac 13$             | $-\frac 13$               | $-\frac 13$                  | 

### Mesons
There are two main 'types' of *meson*, each with sub-types:
- Pions ($\pi^-$, $\pi^0$, $\pi^+$)
- Kaons ($K^-$, $K^0$, $K^+$)
##### Pions
The *strong nuclear force* keeps protons and neutrons bound together within the nucleus, and is one of the for fundamental interactions. Each such interaction is caused by an exchange particle. The *pion* is the exchange particle of the strong nuclear force. It is important to note that *gluons* are also exchange particles for the strong force. The difference is that *gluons* bind quarks together to make *baryons* and *mesons*. *Pions* on the other hand bind baryons together in the nucleus. A similar purpose, but on a larger scale. Together, these exchange particles bring about the *strong force*.
Pions are highly unstable, and will decay into muons, muon-neutrinos and gamma rays in very short amounts of time.

Pions are made of the following:
- $\pi^+$ ($u\overline d$)
- $\pi^-$ ($\overline ud$)
- $\pi^0$ ($u\overline u$ or $d\overline d$ or $s\overline s$)
##### Kaons
It is important to note that with *kaons*, the $K^-$ is the antiparticle version of the $K^+$. Further the $K^0$ is its own antiparticle.
*Kaons* are very heavy and unstable, and so decay into *pions*. They can have unusually long lifetimes, however, this is characteristic of particles containing strange quarks.

Kaons are made of the following:
- $K^+$ ($u\overline s$)
- $K^0$ ($d\overline s$)
- $\overline {K^0}$ ($s\overline d$)
- $K^-$ ($s\overline u$)
##### Meson Hexagon
Below is the meson hexagon. It is a convenient way to show the relevant values associated with *mesons*.
![](MesonHexagon.png)
> The $S$ axis represents the *strangeness* of the particle, and the $Q$ axis represents the charge. The $I$ axis is for *iso-spin*. This is not examined as part of the A-Level specification.

##### Strangeness
Strange particles have a property, $S$ called *strangeness*. Strangeness, like the *baryon number* is a quantum number that only takes certain sets of values. the assigned *strangeness* values are the following:
- strange quark ($s$) has a *strangeness* of -1
- anti-strange quark ($\overline s$) has a *strangeness* of +1
- all other leptons have a *strangeness* of 0
*Strangeness*, much like the *baryon number* is also conserved when reactions take place. However, only when the reaction **creates** strange particles via the strong interaction. When *strange* particles **decay** via the weak interaction, *strangeness* is **not conserved**. Here, strangeness can vary by 0, +1 or -1.
