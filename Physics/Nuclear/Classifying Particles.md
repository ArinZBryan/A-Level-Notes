There are two primary types of sub-atomic particle, **bosons** and **fermions**. A third type, **hadrons** is for sub-atomic particles that exhibit properties of one or the other depending on their composition.

### Bosons
At A-Level, there is not that much to know about some of the bosons. However, there are a few crucial facts to know. 
- Gluons are the exchange particle for the strong nuclear force
- Z and W bosons are the exchange particles for the weak nuclear force
- '*Virtual Photons*' are the exchange particle of the electromagnetic force
- Photons cause the [photoelectric effect](./../Quantum/The%20Photoelectric%20Effect.md)
- Photons are emitted by all baryonic matter above absolute zero. This is called [black-body radiation](./../Thermodynamics/Black%20Body%20Radiation.md), though most of that baryonic matter is not in the form of an ideal black-body radiator.
