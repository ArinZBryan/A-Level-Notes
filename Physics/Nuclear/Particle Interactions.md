### Fundamental Forces
For anything to happen in the universe, there must be a force acting to cause it. 

| Fundamental Force | Interaction                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Gravitational     | Acts between objects with mass               |
| Electromagnetic   | Acts between objects with charge / magnetism |
| Strong Nuclear    | Acts between nucleons                        |
| Weak Nuclear      | Acts between all particles                   | 

Force fields allow a force to act over a distance. When a non-contact force acts on another object, the **momentum** of the object changes.

Each of the four fundamental forces brings about a change in momentum in the particles it acts on. Forces are carried between those particles by sending **exchange particles**. *Exchange particles* are how forces act between particles. They are 'virtual particles' that can't be detected. They only exist for long enough to transfer momentum (and other things) between particles in the interaction. Then they cease existing.

### The Interaction Model
When the blue person throws the ball (the *exchange particle* in this interaction), they will recoil. When the green person catches it, they will also recoil. We know this as a result of conservation of momentum:
**Thrower**
1. Starts at zero momentum
2. Ball gains momentum rightward
3. Person gains equal momentum leftward
**Catcher**
1. Starts at zero momentum
2. Gains rightward momentum

### Exchange Particles
Extending the table above to include the relevant exchange particles:

| Fundamental Force | Interaction                                  | Exchange Particle                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Gravitational     | Acts between objects with mass               | Graviton (Hypothetical)                             |
| Electromagnetic   | Acts between objects with charge / magnetism | Virtual Photon                                      |
| Strong Nuclear    | Acts between nucleons                        | Gluon (Between Quarks) <br/> Meson (Between Nucleons) |
| Weak Nuclear      | Acts between all particles                   | $W^-$ and $Z^-$ Bosons                              |

##### Electromagnetic Force
The electromagnetic force between two charged objects is due to the exchange of a *virtual photon*. This *virtual photon* carries the electrostatic force. Note that this photon is considered 'virtual' because it cannot be detected. If it were detected, then the electromagnetic force would have been stopped from acting.

### Particle Interaction Diagrams (Feynman Diagrams)

The diagram above (known as a *particle interaction* or *Feynman* diagram) is a pictorial representation of a particle interaction or transformation. It is used to represent the state of particles before and after the interaction takes place.

1. In a *Feynman diagram*, straight lines represent matter and antimatter particles
2. Exchange particles are represented by a wiggly line.
3. The Y-axis represents **time**. Thus, all arrows must be forwards in time from an initial state to a final state.
4. The vertex V is at the moment of interaction.
5. The lines representing particles must be labelled.
### The Weak Nuclear Force
During *beta-minus decay*, a neutron turns into a proton and an electron. The electron is then instantly emitted (as a $\beta^-$ particle) along with an antineutrino.
$$n\rightarrow p + e^- + \overline{v_e}$$

Similarly, during *beta-plus decay*, a proton turns into a neutron and a positron. The positron is then instantly emitted (as a $\beta^+$ particle) along with a neutrino.
$$p\rightarrow n + e^+ + v_e$$
A force called the **weak nuclear force** causes the interaction between neutrinos and antineutrinos with other particles. These interactions are due to the exchange of particles called **W bosons**. 
*W bosons*:
- Have a non-zero rest mass
- Have a very short range (< 0.001fm)
- Are positively charged ($W^+$) or negatively charged ($W^-$)
