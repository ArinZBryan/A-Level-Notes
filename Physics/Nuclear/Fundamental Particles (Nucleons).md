### Cosmic Radiation
Cosmic radiation is high-energy particles arriving from outer-space. Approximately 89% protons, 10% are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and 1% are other, heavier nuclei. When these particles collide with nuclei in the upper atmosphere, they create more particles. This process has allowed us to discover various particles released:
- Positron (Anti-Electron)
- Pions 
- Muons 
### The Standard Model
![Particle Zoo](particle-zoo.drawio.svg)
> Note that for every matter particle (Quarks and Leptons), there exists a corresponding [antimatter](Particles%20and%20Anti-Particles) particle with opposing charges but the same mass.

In the above diagram, particles are classified according to the way in which they interact with each other. This then depends on which of the fundamental forces they experience.

- All nucleons experience the weak nuclear force, and specifically, the $Z$ and $W$ bosons are the exchange particles in any interactions involving it.
- Only the quarks experience the strong nuclear force, with gluons acting as the exchange particle in interactions involving it.
- All charged particles (All quarks and some leptons) experience the electromagnetic force. Interactions with the electromagnetic force are carried out with the photon as the exchange particle.

> Side Note: The different types of quark are called 'flavours' of quarks
