Nuclear equations, such as the one shown below, are used to represent radioactive decay. Nuclear equations must always be balanced:
$$^{238}_{92}U\rightarrow ^{234}_{90}Th + ^{4}_{2}He$$
Remember, these are the following symbols for the following radioactive particles
- Alpha : $^4_2\alpha = ^4_2He$
- Beta : $^0_{-1}\beta = ^0_1e$
- Gamma : $^0_0\gamma$
