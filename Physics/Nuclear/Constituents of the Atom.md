### Definitions
- Atom
	The smallest unit of an element
- Nucleus
	The centre of an atom where the protons and neutrons reside
- Nucleon
	One of the particles of the nucleus
- Nuclide
	A specific type of nucleus (eg. a nuclide of $C^{12}$)
- Isotope
	Atoms with the same number of protons and a different number of neutrons

### The structure of the atom
An atom has a radius of about $1\times 10^{-10}$ metres. The nucleus' radius is approximately $5\times 10^{-16}$ metres. Almost all of the space taken up by an atom is just empty space.

### Ionisation
When an atom loses or gains electrons, it may become ionised. This is because the balancing negative charge provided by the electrons has been removed.

### Masses
|          | Relative Mass | Relative Charge |
| -------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Proton   | 1             | +1              |
| Neutron  | 1             | 0               |
| Electron | ~1/2000       | -1              | 

### A reminder of atomic Notation
$$^{23}_{11}Na$$
- The top number is the mass number (= num. protons + num. neutrons)
- The bottom number is the atomic number (= num. protons)
- The Letters - the chemical symbol
> A further reminder:
> Atoms have *no overall charge* - if the charge stops being zero, then the atom becomes an ion.

Atoms that have the same number of protons, but **different number of neutrons** are known as **isotopes**
### What makes atoms stable?
If an atom has too many neutrons, then the nucleus will be unbalanced (unstable) and want to regain stability. An unstable nucleus will be radioactive and will decay into more stable nuclei (these may not be stable themselves, but will be *more* stable than their predecessor.)
### Specific Charge
The specific charge of a particle = charge of particle / mass of particle. Thus, the units of specific charge is Coulombs per kilogram.
