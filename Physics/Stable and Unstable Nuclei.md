### Radiation
The constituents of an atom's nucleus can change via only one method, emitting radioactivity. There are, of course, three methods for doing so, alpha decay, beta decay and emitting gamma rays.
##### Alpha Particles
An alpha particle ($\alpha$) is actually a helium nucleus, that is, it is made from two neutrons and two protons.

The specific charge of an alpha particle is:
$4.8\times 10^7\space C kg^-1$
##### Beta Particles
Beta particles come in two forms: $\beta^+$ and $\beta^-$, a positron and electron respectively. However, to become a beta particle, they must be going really quite quickly.
When a neutron decays, it will decay into a proton, a beta minus particle and an electron antineutrino.
##### Gamma Rays
A gamma ray is electromagnetic radiation from the nucleus of an atom. As such, it has no charge.

### What makes a nucleus unstable?
The forces in the nucleus determine what makes it stable or not. As the particles in the nucleus are often charged, there is an electrostatic force between the particle.
There are two major problems with this model:
1. The electrons will be attracted to the positive protons isn't the nucleus
2. The positive protons in the nucleus will repel each other.
Thus, we can conclude that there must be a stronger force in the nucleus holding it together. This is called the strong nuclear force.
### The Strong Nuclear and Electrostatic Forces
The strong nuclear force acts between **nucleons**, keeping the nucleus stable by overcoming the electrostatic force of repulsion between the protons in the nucleus. It is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. 
The strength of the strong nuclear force between two nucleons varies with distance. 

> It is important to note that the strong nuclear force applies between two protons, two neutrons or a proton and a neutron identically.

The electrostatic force also applies, with a different pattern.
