Below is a graph of the distance ($d$) between any two random galaxies against the age of the universe ($t$):

	Assuming constant expansion, then the *Hubble Constant* ($H_0$) is equal to $\frac{1}{t}$, where $t$ is the current age of the universe.
Also, $\rho$ is the average density of the universe, and $\Omega_0$ is the 'critical density'
> Note that the equation given for the constant expansion scenario is actually called *Hubble's Law*, where $v$ is the velocity of a receding galaxy, $d$ is the distance of the galaxy from us, and $H_0$ is the Hubble constant.
### Dark Matter
It exists? There is some controversy here.
