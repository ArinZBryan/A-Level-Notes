Below is a graph of the distance ($d$) between any two random galaxies against the age of the universe ($t$):

Assuming constant expansion, then the *Hubble Constant* ($H_0$) is equal to $\frac{1}{t}$, where $t$ is the current age of the universe.
Also, $\rho$ is the average density of the universe
