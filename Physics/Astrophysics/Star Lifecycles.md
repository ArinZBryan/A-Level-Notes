Some major points:
1. A star's main sequence only starts when the star begins to fuse hydrogen into helium. This requires massive temperatures and pressures.
2. The red giant / supergiant phase starts only when fusion of helium begins. Any and all elements heavier than helium and lighter than (and including) iron are made in this phase.
3. Though black dwarves have been included, as their existence is widely hypothesised, none have yet been detected. It is theorised that the universe has not existed long enough for stars to reach this point in their lifecycle.
