> At A-Level HR diagrams only contain the luminosity and temperature axis. Luminosity is found by using the inverse square law, and temperature is found by using the equations relating to [black body radiators](./../Thermodynamics/Black%20Body%20Radiation.md).
> It is important to note that both of these axis are logarithmic, though the exact numbers are not required. Also **the temperature axis is reversed**, that is, the the temperature *decreases* further right, and *increases* further left.

### Main Sequence
1. Start with a nebula: cloud of gas, mostly hydrogen and helium.
2. Collapses due to gravitational attraction.
3. Forms proto-star 
4. Temperature and pressure increase until fusion of hydrogen begins to occur in the core.
5. We now have a [main sequence star](./Star%20Lifecycles.md).
