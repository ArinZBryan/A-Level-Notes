### Reflection
Reflection happens when a wave hits a surface. This can even include changes within the same material. It is important to note that the angle of reflection is always the same as the angle of incidence, except mirrored around the normal to the surface.

### Refraction
Refraction is what happens when a wave passes through a surface and into the material. Refraction is caused by the changing of the wave speed it enters the material, as each different material has a different 'maxmimum wave speed', (eg. speed of light, $c$). If the wave is speeding up by going into the material, the angle of refraction will bend away from the normal to the surface, conversely, if the wave is slowing down. it will bend towards the normal. This is often quoted in terms of refractive indeces, where moving into a higher refactive index material will result in a bend away from the normal.

### Total Internal Reflection
When a wave hits a surface, some of it may be reflected, and some may be refracted. However, there is a situation, when refraction results in effective reflection. This is in the situation of total internal reflection. This happens when a wave is exiting a material with an angle of incidence greater than the limiting angle, the '*Critical Angle*' and is exiting into a less dense material. Beyond this angle, the wave is reflected in entirety back from the boundary surface into the material from which it was incident. 

Total internal reflection is commonly used in fibre-optic cable, allowing the light inside to travel for long distances with minimal attenuation.
