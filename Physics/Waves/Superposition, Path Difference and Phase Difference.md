### The principle of superposition
If two or more waves meet, then the result is the vector sum of the displacements. In effect, this means that there is constructive interference (so an increased amplitude) if the waves are in phase, and destructive interference (a reduced amplitude) if the wave are in antiphase.

### Path Difference

$||\underline{Ax}| - |\underline{Bx}|| = P_{athDifference}$

### Phase Difference
$\frac{P_{athDifference}}{\lambda} \mod 1 = P_{haseDifference}$

The above equation results in a value between 0 and 1. This can be multiplied by $360^\circ$ or $2\pi$ to get the value in radians or degrees.
