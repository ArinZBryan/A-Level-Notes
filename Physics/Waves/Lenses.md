### Lens Diagrams

![Example Lens Diagram](exampleLensDiagram.png)

A lens diagram is used to graphically find the image of an object through a lens, given the lens' position, focal points and the object's position relative to the lens. It is important to note that when drawing such lens diagrams, a convex lens is represented as a line with arrowheads at each end, and a concave lens as a straight line with upside-down arrowheads at the tips.

### Images
When using a lens, there are two types of image that can be produced: real and virtual. A real image is formed when the light rays reaching your eyes have bounced off the object, and passed through the lens. This type of image is called real because it accurately reflects the real-world position and scale of the objects depicted within. A virtual image is called what it is because it *does not* accurately represent these things. This results in the image appearing to be on the same side of the lens as the object itself.

#### Using Lenses
There are four main situations that need to be known, as shown below:

|   Object Position   |                     Convex                     | Concave |     |
| :-----------------: | :--------------------------------------------: | :-----: | --- |
| Before Focal Length |             Enlarged Virtual Image             |         |     |
|   At Focal Length   |      Virtual Image At Infinity (No Image)      |         |     |
| After Focal Length  |          Enlarged Inverted Real Image          |         |     |
| At 2x Focal Length  |     Inverted Real Image (No Magnification)     |         |     |
| Beyond Focal Length | Inverted Diminished Real Image at Focal Length |         |     |

### Lens Equations
The following equations apply to 'thin' lenses. Such lens is assumed to only bend the light once, unlike real lenses.

#### Lens Focal Length
$\frac{1}{I_{dist}} + \frac{1}{O_{dist}} = \frac{1}{f}$ 

$\frac{1}{I_{height}} + \frac{1}{O_{height}} = \frac{1}{f}$
> - $I_{dist}$ - Image distance from lens
> - $O_{dist}$ - Object distance from lens
> - $I_{height}$ - Image height
> - $O_{height}$ - Object height
> - $f$ - focal length

**Note:** The values are only positive if the image formed is real.

#### Lens Power and Magnification
$m = \frac{I_{height}}{O_{height}}$
> - $I_{height}$ - Image height
> - $O_{height}$ - Object height
> - $m$ - Magnification

$P = \frac{1}{f}$
> - $P$ - Power
> - $f$ - Focal Length

$P = \frac{1}{O_{height}} + \frac{1}{I_{height}}$
> - $P$ - Power
> - $O_{height}$ - Object height
> - $I_{height}$ - Image height
