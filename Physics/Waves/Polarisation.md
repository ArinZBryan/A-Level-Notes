A transverse wave oscillates a right angles to the direction of propagation. This means that the direction of oscillation can be any angle in the resulting plane. Both of the waves shown below are of the same phase, but are polarised 90 degrees away from each other.

One major thing to note, is that this only occurs for transverse waves. As the direction of oscillation is parallel to the direction of motion in a longitudinal wave, it cannot be polarised.

### A Simple Experiment
Using two polaroid filters, rotate one 90 degrees with respect to the other. Notice how this prevents any light from passing through the two together.

Though this isn't needed for A-Level, the graph of the intensity of the light through the two filters as you rotate them is actually $I = \cos^2A$

### Light Sources
It is important to note that most light is 'unpolarised'. This includes sunlight, and almost all light made by bulbs, filament, LED or halogen. Unpolarised light is not actually special, in fact the word 'unpolarised' just means that the light is made of a mixture of all polarisations.

## Coherence
For two waves to be coherent, they must have the same speed, wavelength and frequency. They **do not** need to be in phase though. Coherent light is that which fulfils all of these requirements. The most common way to produce this kind of light is by use of a laser. Such lasers always produce only coherent light.
