A standing wave is produced when two waves of equal phase interact. The interference that this causes results in the 'standing wave'. Such a standing wave displays the form of an ordinary wave, i.e.. the oscillating of the particles within the wave, however the wave itself appears stationary.

## Node Types
There are two types of node in a standing wave: *antinodes* and *nodes*. All standing waves show at least one of each type.

### Nodes
A node is produced by destructive interference. This results in a part of the wave that appears to be entirely still. Such nodes also always occur when the wave is reflected from a point an integer multiple of the wavelength away from the emitter.

### Antinodes
An antinode is produced by constructive interference. It is a part of a wave that exhibits the maximum change in displacement from the point of rest.

## Standing waves in a string
In a string, kept taut at both ends, a standing wave will exhibit a *node* at each end, as well as at least one *antinode* between them. If only one *antinode* is present, then the wave is of the '**fundamental frequency**' (or the **first harmonic**). In this state, the distance between the end nodes is exactly _half_ the wavelength. Increasing the frequency of the standing wave allows for higher-order harmonics to be achieved. For these harmonics, additional _nodes_/_antinodes_ can be found between the ends. (eg. 2nd harmonic = N A N A N, 3rd harmonic = N A N A N A N) 

Note: This type of wave is transverse.

## Standing waves in a pipe
Unlike standing waves in a string, this type of standing wave is made using longitudinal waves (normally sound waves). This means that instead of the oscillation showing _nodes_/_antinodes_, it is instead the pressure that shows them, through areas of compression and rarefaction. There are three fundamental scenarios for standing waves in a pipe, listed below.

### No Open Ends 
In this situation, the wave in the pipe behaves exactly the same as the wave in a string, with both ends kept taut. See [that section](#standing-waves-in-a-string) for more information.

### One Open End
In this case, the wave in the pipe always has a *node* at the closed end, and an *antinode* at the open end. Otherwise the wave behaves similarly to before, except that only the odd order harmonics are present. In this configuration, it is impossible to generate 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc. order harmonics. 

**Note**: There is an equation relating to this situation: $f_n=\frac{nv}{4L}$, where $n$ is the harmonic's order, $v$ is the wave speed, $L$ is the length of the pipe and $f_n$ is the frequency at the harmonic $n$. Note that $n$ **must** be an odd integer

### Two Open Ends
Here, the wave in the pipe always has *antinodes* at both ends. This is because the open end acts as a surface for *antinodes* to be reflected off. Unlike with one end closed, this situation allows for any harmonic to be expressed. 

**Note**: There is an equation relating to this case: $f_n = \frac{nv}{2L}$, where $n$ is the harmonic's order, $v$ is the wave speed, $L$ is the length of the pipe and $f_n$ is the frequency at the harmonic $n$.
