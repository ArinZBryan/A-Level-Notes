## Types of waves
### <u>Transverse</u>
A wave where the direction of oscillation is in the direction perpendicular to that of the propagation/energy transfer
### <u>Longitudinal</u>
A wave where the direction of oscillation is in the direction parallel to that of the propagation /  energy transfer. 

Longitudinal waves often consist of waves of high and low pressure. The high pressure is at the crests of the wave, and low pressure at the troughs. These areas of high and low pressure are said to have undergone compression and rarefaction respectively.
## Wave Properties
### <u>Amplitude</u>
The distance between the crest / trough of a wave and the point of rest.
or 
The magnitude of the displacement between the crest / trough and the point of rest

### <u>Frequency</u>
The number of waves that pass a point per unit time.
 = 1/Time Period 
### <u>Time Period</u>
The time taken for a full wave to pass
 = 1/Frequency
### <u>Wave Speed</u>
The distance travelled by the wave per unit time
### <u>Wavelength</u>
The distance between two equivalent positions on a wave. Just because the displacement is the same, that does not mean the position on the wave is equivalent
## Intensity
$$I = \frac{P}{A}$$
Where $I$ is intensity in $WM^{-2}$, $P$ is power and $A$ is the area the light covers.
There is a special case of this for a point light source, shining in all direction: $$I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$
