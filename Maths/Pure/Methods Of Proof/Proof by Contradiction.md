The crux of proof by contradiction is to assume that the thing you are proving is wrong. Then, using that assumption, or the assumption that an opposite fact is true (eg. "All Squares are even" vs "All Squarea are odd"), prove that there is some logical contradiction.

This most often takes the form of two things that *should* be equal, being obviously not equal. However, it could also be a contradiction with one of the other stipulations of the proof (eg. $x \in \mathbb{N}$, and yet $\frac{x}{2}=1$).
