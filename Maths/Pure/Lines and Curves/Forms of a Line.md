There are two major ways of expressing a straight line:
- $y = mx + c$
- $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
	- This is also known as point-slope form

Point-slope form can be very useful, as it avoids the process of subbing in values to obtain $c$. This process can be error prone, and so it is advisable to use point-slope form when possible.
