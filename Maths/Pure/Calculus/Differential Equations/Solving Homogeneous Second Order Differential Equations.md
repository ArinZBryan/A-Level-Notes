If solving a differential equation of the form:
$$a\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+b\frac{dy}{dx} + cy = 0$$
we can turn this into an auxiliary equation (abbreviated as AE) of the form $a\lambda^2+b\lambda+c=0$, solving for $\lambda$.

The general solution (GS) is then equal to $y = Ae^{\lambda_1x}+Be^{\lambda_2x}$, if $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are roots to the above quadratic.

### Two real roots
If both roots are real and distinct, then the general solution is the above equation: $y = Ae^{\lambda_1x}+Be^{\lambda_2x}$. 

### One real root
If the roots are real, but are repeated, then the GS is $y = (A+Bx)e^{\lambda x}$.

### Imaginary roots
If the roots are imaginary, then the GS is of the form: $y = e^{px}(A\cos(qx)+B\sin(qx))$, where the roots are of the form $p \pm qi$.
