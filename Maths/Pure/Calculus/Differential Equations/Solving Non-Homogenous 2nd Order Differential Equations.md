A Non-Homogenous 2nd order differential equation is of the form:
$$a\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + b\frac{dy}{d2} + cy = f(x)$$
The general solution of this equation is such that it is equal to the complimentary function (abbreviated as CF) plus the particular integral (PI) of the left hand side, where the PI is of the form of the function $f(x)$. 

### Steps to solution
1. Find the AE of the left hand side.
2.
