It is possible to use the [T-formulae](./../../Trigonometry/T-Formulae.md) as a substitution when doing integration by substitution. By making the substitution: $x = \tan\frac x2$, we can make the following substitution:
$$\int 1dx = \int1\cdot\frac{2}{1+t^2}dt$$
 Generally, this substitution is used when the top of a fraction can be reduced to some multiple of $(1 + t^2)$ which can then be cancelled.
