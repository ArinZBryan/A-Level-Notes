Sometimes, when doing an integration, you will need to integrate a badly behaved function. This is usually because it has an asymptote that must be worked around. For instance, this must be used when integrating around zero for $y = \frac 1x$ and around $\frac{\pi}{2}$ when integrating $y = \tan x$. The method is as follows:
1. Integrate indefinitely like normal. No special techniques are needed here.
2. Apply bounds to the indefinite integral
3. Split the definite integral into two (or more) integrals with bounds on the asymptotes.
4. Set the bounds on the asymptotes to be variables. The value of the integral here is the limit as these variables approach the asymptote. Sometimes, it may be necessary to specify which side the limit comes from, as it is with $y = \frac 1x$. 
5. Take a limit on the variables as they approach the asymptote.
6. Find the value of the definite integral as the limit approaches its value.
