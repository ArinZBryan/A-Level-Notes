# The Trapezium Rule
The trapezium rule is a way of approximating integrations by using linear approximation. It splits up the area under a curve into a number of equal with trapeziums, and adds their area. This is far more doable, as the area of a trapezium is just the average of the parallel side lengths times the perpendicular height.

If the limit of this is taken, with the widths of the trapeziums approaching zero, this is another form of integration from first principles.

**Note:** If the curve is convex, then this produces an over-estimation, whereas when the curve is concave, then the trapezium rule produces an under estimation. This may be asked in an exam.
