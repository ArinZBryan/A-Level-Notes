# Differentiation Rules

There are three rules used for differentiation that come up all the time, and are generally applicable.

## Product Rule
$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)g(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$  

This rule is used whenever two things are multiplied together, and cannot be expanded to a series of added terms.

## Quotient Rule
$\frac{d}{dx}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{(g(x)^2)}$  

This rule is used whenever two things are divided by eachother. This rule is actually derived from the product rule by taking the reciprocal of $f(x)$

## Chain Rule
$\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = g'(x)f'(g(x))$

In this case, this can be more succinctly expressed by saying that the derivative of one function inside another is equal to the derivative of the inside function times the derivative of the outside function, but with the inside function still inside.

### An alternate form of the chain rule

$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dt} * \frac{dt}{dx}$

This version of the chain rule also finds several applications and is worth memorising.
