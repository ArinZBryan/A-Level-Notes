# Parametric Differentiation
If a curve is specified using a parametric equation, especially one that is not simple to make cartesian, then the best way to get the gradient is via parametric differentiation. 

This method makes use of the chain rule to result in the following formula:

$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}} $$
