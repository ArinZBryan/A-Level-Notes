There are three main operations that can be performed between two vectors:

## Addition
To add two matricies $\underline{A}$ and $\underline{B}$, simply add the values of the matricies of the same row and column. If the matricies are not of the same size, then this cannot be done.

## Multiplication with a scalar
To multiply a matrix $\underline{M}$ with a scalar $s$, simply multiply each cell of the matrix by the scalar $s$. This matrix operation works regardless of matrix.

## Multiplication with another matrix
To multiply a matrix $\underline{A}$ with another matrix $\underline{B}$:

For each cell in the resulting matrix:
- Pair each value in the row of the first matrix and the column of the second matrix
- Multiply each pair
- Add the numbers
- This is the value in this cell

This matrix operation can only be performed if the second matrix has the same number of rows as the first matrix has columns.
