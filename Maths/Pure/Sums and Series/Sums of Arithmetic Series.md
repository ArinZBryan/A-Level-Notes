# Sums of Arithmetic series
An arithmetic series of the form $x_n = a + d(n-1)$ can be summed. It is possible that in an exam, that you will be asked to derive the sum of such an arithmetic sequence.

Forwards: 

$S_n = a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + \dots + (a + n -1)d)$

Backwards:

$S_n = (a+(n-1)d) + \dots + (a+3d) + (a+2d) + (a+d) + a$

Together:

$2S_n = n(2a + (n-1)d)$
$S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d)$
