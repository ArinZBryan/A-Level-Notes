L'Hopital's rule states that the limit of a quotient equals the limit of the quotient of the [derivatives](./../Calculus/Differentiation/Differentiation.md) of the numerators and denominators
$$\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$

Note that when using L'Hopital's rule, it is useful to know the following identity:
$$\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x\to c}(f(x))}{\lim_{x\to c}(g(x))}$$
