- $P(Event)$ - The probability of an event happening
- $P(A \cup B)$ - The probability of $A$ and/or $B$ happening
- $P(A \cap B)$ - The probability of $A$ and $B$ happening
	- $= P(A) \times P(B)$ when $A$ and $B$ are independent
- $P(A | B)$ - The probability of $A$ happening given $B$ has already happened
	- $= \frac {P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
