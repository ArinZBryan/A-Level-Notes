A population is: the <u>whole</u> set of items that are of interest

A sample is the name given to some subset of the population intended to represent the population.

Each individual thing in the population that can be samples is known as a sampling unit.

Often sampling units of a population are individually 
named or numbered to **form a list** called the **sampling frame**. It can be said that a sampling frame is a *sub-population* of the overall population that we are interested in.
>An example:
>Suppose we want to survey all the people in London (this is the population). A *sampling frame* could be the phone book / directory (the [yellow pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages)). The *sample* taken would be the list of people that pick up the phone. Each person that picks up the phone is a *sampling unit*.

We can collect data either from a sample, or from the entire population. Data collected from the entire population is known as a **census**
