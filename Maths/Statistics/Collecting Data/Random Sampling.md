Ordinarily we would want each thing in our sampling frame to have an **equal chance of being chosen**, in order to **avoid bias**.  
This is known as <u><i>random sampling</i></u>. There are a few ways to do this...

## Simple Random Sampling
### What is it?
Every [sample](./Populations%20and%20Samples.md) has an equal chance of being selected.
### Method:
In [sampling frames](./Populations%20and%20Samples.md) <u>each item has an identifying number.</u> Use a <u>random number generator</u>, or '*lottery sampling*' (eg. picking names from a hat)
### Advantages
- Bias free
- Easy and cheap to implement
- Each number has a known equal chance of being selected
### Disadvantages
- Not suitable when the population size is large
- Sampling frames needed.

## Systematic Sampling
### What is it?
Required elements are chosen at regular intervals in an ordered list.
ie. Take every k<sup>th</sup> elements where:
$k = \frac{PopulationSize(N)}{SampleSize(n)}$
starting at random items between $1$ and $k$.
### Advantages
- Simple and quick to use.
- Suitable for large samples / populations
### Disadvantages
- [Sampling frame](./Populations%20and%20Samples.md) again needed.
- Can introduce bias if [sampling frame](./Populations%20and%20Samples.md) is not adequately random.

## Stratified Sampling
### What is it?
[Population](./Populations%20and%20Samples.md) divided into groups (strata) and a ***simple random sample*** is carried out in each group/strata.
Same proportion ($\frac{SampleSize(n)}{PopulationSize(N)}$) is sampled from each strata.  
Often used when the sample is large, and the population naturally divides into groups.
### Advantages
- Reflects population structure
- Guarantees proportional representation of groups within populations
### Disadvantages
- [Population](./Populations%20and%20Samples.md) must be clearly identified into distinct strata
- Selection from within each stratum suffers from same disadvantages as ***simple random sampling***
