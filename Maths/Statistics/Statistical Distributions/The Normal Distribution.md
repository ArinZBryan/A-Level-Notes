## Standard Normal Distribution
The standard normal distribution is one where the mean is zero, and the standard deviation is 1. This can be represented in two ways:
$X~N(0,1^2)$ or $\phi(Z)$, where $Z = \frac{X -\mu}{\sigma}$

This coding, $Z = \frac{X -\mu}{\sigma}$ is required to transform any normal distribution into the standard normal distribution.

It is common to be given this normal distribution in a table on the formula sheet. The table supplied will be quite small though, as you are expected to do everything using the CG-50, eliminating the need to code for the standard normal distribution.
