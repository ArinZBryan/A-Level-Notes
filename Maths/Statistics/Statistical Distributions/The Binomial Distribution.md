You can model a random variable $X$ with a binomial distribution $B(n,p)$ if:
- there are a fixed number of trials, n,
- there is a fixed probability of success $p$.
It is important to note that this distribution can only be used for 'binary' outcomes, where either there is a chance of success or a chance of failure, where both the chances add to 1.

### Other Values
When using a binomial distribution, the following values can be calculated
- Mean ($\mu$) $=np$
- Variance ($\sigma^2$) $=np(1-p)$
- Standard Deviation ($\sigma$) $= \sqrt{np(1-p)}$
These formulas are given in the formula book, and become relevant when looking at approximating the binomial distribution using the [normal distribution](./The%20Normal%20Distribution.md)
