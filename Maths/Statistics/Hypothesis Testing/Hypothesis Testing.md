# Hypothesis testing

## Definitions
### Hypothesis
A **hypothesis** is a statement made about the value of a population parameter that we wish to test by collecting evidence in the form of a sample.

### Null Hypothesis
The **null hypothesis**, $H_0$ is the default position, i.ie. that nothing has changed, unless proven otherwise.

### Alternative Hypothesis
The **alternative hypothesis**, $H_1$ is that there has been some change in the population parameter/

### Test Statistics
In a hypothesis test, evidence from the sample is called a **test statistic**

### Level of significance
The **level of significance** ($\alpha$) is the maximum probability where we would reject the null hypothesis.
> This is usually 5% or 1%

### Tailed Tests
The below example is an example of a **one-tailed test**, as a specific bias is being tested for. A **two-tailed test** is one where any bias is being tested for. Eg. $H_0 : p = 0.5$, $H_1 : p \ne 0.5$ . One thing to note: when dealing with levels of significance in two-tailed tests, the level of significance must be split between the tails.
## An Example
"I throw a coin 10 times. For what numbers of heads might you conclude that the coin is biased towards heads?"

**What Are We Asking?**
- Is the coin biased?
- Is the probability $p$ of getting heads 0.5.
- Is the distribution ~B(10,0.5)

**The Null Hypothesis**
- The coin is fair, $p = 0.5$

**The Alternative Hypothesis**
- The coin is biased towards heads, ie. $p > 0.5$
