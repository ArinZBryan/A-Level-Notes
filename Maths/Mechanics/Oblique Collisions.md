### Magnitude and Angle
Assume the following situation, a particle of mass $m$ travelling at a speed $u$ m/s hits a smooth immovable plane at an angle $\alpha$. It then rebounds at an angle $\beta$ with speed $v$.

In this situation, we can calculate some important values.
As momentum is conserved parallel to the plane, we know that:
$$mu\cos\alpha = mv\cos\beta$$
$$\therefore u\cos\alpha = v\cos\beta$$
We also know, that if the plane and particle have a coefficient of restitution of $e$, where $0 \lt e \leq 1$ we can calculate the speed in the perpendicular component.
$$eu\sin\alpha = v\sin\beta$$
Using these two equations, we can make two more useful ones.
$$e\tan\alpha = \tan\beta$$
$$(u\cos\alpha)^2 + (eu\cos\alpha)^2 = v^2$$
Using these equations, we can now solve for all the possible needed values.
### Vectors
When using vectors, the following is true:
$$m\underline u  \cdot \underline{\hat w} = m\underline v  \cdot \underline{\hat w}$$
Therefore:
$$\underline u  \cdot \underline{w} = \underline v  \cdot \underline{w}$$
This is derived from the formula for the dot product, and is for the components parallel to the plane.
When dealing with components perpendicular to the plane:
$$\underline I = m(\underline v - \underline u)$$
> Note that: $\underline v = - \underline u$

$$\underline v \cdot \underline{\hat{I}} = - e(\underline u \cdot \underline{\hat{I}})$$
$$\underline v \cdot \underline{I} = - e(\underline u \cdot \underline{I})$$
