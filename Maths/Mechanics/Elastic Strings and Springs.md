$$T = \frac{\lambda x}{l}$$
$$EPE = \frac{\lambda x^2}{2l}$$
The difference between an elastic string and a spring is that an elastic string will only exert force when the string is taut or being stretched, but a spring will exert force any time it is not at its original length $l$, or rather the extension $x$ is not zero.

$\lambda$ is the modulus of elasticity and is measured in newtons.
