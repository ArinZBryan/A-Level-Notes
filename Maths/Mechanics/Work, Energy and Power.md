###  Work-Energy Principle
Conservation of energy can be summarised with the following statement:
$$\text{Energy In} = \text{Work Out}$$
We can then break this down:
$$\text{KE}_\text{pre} + \text{GPE}_\text{pre} + \text{EPE}_\text{pre} + \text{W}_{driving} = \text{KE}_\text{post} + \text{GPE}_\text{post} + \text{EPE}_\text{post} + \text{W}_{friction}$$
In words, this means that the sum of kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy before the movement and the work done by the driving forces is equal to the kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy after the move, and the work done against friction.

### Driving Power
A common thing to find in a question is a vehicle with an engine driving at a fixed power. We can from this, find the force being applied by the engine as a driving force.
As $\text{Energy} = \text{Force}\times\text{Distance}$, and $\text{Energy} = \frac{\text{Power}}{\text{Time}}$,
we get that $\text{Energy} = \text{Force}\times\text{Speed}$
