### Perfectly Elastic Collisions
Assume the following particles, $A$ and $B$:

For a collision to occur: $\underline{u_1} > \underline{u_2}$. Therefore, $\underline{v_2} > \underline{v_1}$.

### Inelastic collisions
In real-life, particles deform during collisions. During thus time, the particles are touching for a time ($t$). This is called the *period of restitution*. During the collision:

$$\underline{I_A} = - \underline {I_B}$$
$$m_A(\underline{v_A}-\underline{u_A}) = -m_B(\underline{v_B} - \underline{u_B})$$
$$m_A\underline{v_A}-m_A\underline{u_A} = -m_B\underline{v_B} - m_B\underline{u_B}$$
$$m_A\underline{v_A} + m_B\underline{v_B} = m_A\underline{u_B}+m_B\underline{u_B}$$
> This is called conservation of linear momentum. (Total initial momentum = Total final momentum)
