### Waterfall
| Advantages                                                       | Disadvanages                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy to implement in large or changing teams                     | Design isn't adaptive, when a flaw is found, the process needs to start over                                   |
| Forces structured, disciplined organization                      | Method doesn't incorporate mid-process user or client feedback, makes changes based on results                 |
| Simplifies the plan, making it easier for everyone to understand | Waterfall model delys testing until the end of the develpment lifecycle                                        |
| Enables design to be done early                                  | Does not consider error correcion                                                                              |
| Clearly defines milestones to work towards                       | Waterfall doesn't let processes overlap for simultaneous work on different phases, reducing overall efficiency |
|                                                                  | No working product is available until the end of the cycle                                                     |
|                                                                  | Waterfall isn't useful in ongoing projects                                                                                                               |

### Spiral
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---- | ---- |
| Highly Flexible | The cost of doing this model is quite high |
| Monitoring the project is easy, as each cycle requires review before the next can begin | High expertise can be needed to execute this well |
| Risk management is very easy | Rules and protocols must be followed to properly implement this model |
| Changes are easy to make late into software development | Reusing the same code between projects can be quite hard |
| Estimates of project scope, schedule and budget become clearer as the project goes on | Running over budget and overtime can be quite common. |
| Suitable for high-projects where continued development is not guaranteed |  |

### Agile
| Advantages                                            | Disadvantages                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Highly flexible                                       | It can be hard to exert control over the direction a project takes |
| Improved communication (more frequently)              | This method can produce less documentation than other methods      |
| Reduced risks due to generally having working product | Requires a high level of collaboration and teamwork                |
| Can lead to increased customer satisfaction           | Complex projects can be lengthened by more frequent meetings and documentation                                                                   |
### Extreme Programming
Extreme programming, sometimes abbreviated as XP is a system that involves the use of the Agile development method, combined with significant quantities of tests. In general, this is just corporate manager speak for 'do a good job'. Thus, most of the information on this topic is just spinning it's wheels.
