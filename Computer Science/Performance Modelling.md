Performance modelling is the process of simulating idfferent user and system configurations and loads by using mathematical approximation, rather than real-world testing (which would be more desireable to do). This is generally done as real-word testing can be costly, both in terms of time and money. 

### Synthetics Workloads
It is possible to test an application or workload by running it against real-world data. However, sometimes such data is not available, and a synthetic test is used. Some examples of synthetic tests are:
- Simulated DDoS attacks on networks
- Simulated network traffic
- Example 3D rendering
- Highly expensive computational workloads
