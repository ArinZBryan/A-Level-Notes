## IP addresses
An IP address is effectively the address of a computer or network on the internet. They may be assigned to a single computer, or more often to a single network or group of computers on a network.

There are two types of IP address, IPv4 and IPv6, with different structures:
- IPv4
    Consists of 4 8-bit fields, totalling 32 bits
- IPv6
    Consists of 8 16-bit fields, totalling 128 bits

IPv6 only exists because all of the IPv4 addresses were used.
