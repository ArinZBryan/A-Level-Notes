## Computer Misuse Act (1990)
There are two main provisions to this act pertaining to the unauthorised access of computer material:
1. It is illegal to gain access with the intent of committing further crimes (such as blackmailing)
2. With the intent to modify or add to any material found there. This includes writing to the filesystem, or to RAM.

## Freedom of Information Act (2000)
This act has two major parts:
1. Public authorities are required to publish certain data about what they do.
2. Members of the public can make 'Freedom of Information' requests to public bodies regarding information held on their activities, and on information pertaining to themselves

## Communications Act (2003)
This act makes it a crime to:
1. Access an internet connection without authorisation. This mostly just means that access must be paid for to the relevant body/company, however, this also makes it illegal to access a neighbour's WIFI without their permission.
2. Using offensive language online. This largely pertains to social medias. It is important to note that this also includes the spreading of offensive language not originally posted by yourself. (eg. retweeting)

## Data Protection Act (1998)
This act pertains to the data that companies, and in some cases parts of the government can collect about you. **Note**: This act was originally EU legislation, and thus has been grandfathered in from that source. 
1. Data held should be relevant and not excessive in size.
2. Data should be accurate and up to date.
3. Data should only be kept for as long as is necessary
4. Individuals have the right to access the data held about them, and should be able to check and update it if necessary.
5. Security must be in place to prevent unauthorised access to the data.
6. Data may not be transferred outside the EU unless the country has adequate data protection legislation.
There are some exceptions to this act: national security, crime, taxation and domestic purposes. This means that when it is in relation to any of these purposes, then this law does not apply. Data that is used for individual and household purposes is also exempt from this act.

## Copyright, Designs and Patents Act / CDPA (1988)
This is quite a large act which was not originally designed for computer software. Thus, amendments to the act prevent an individual or organisation from copying, modifying or distributing intellectual property without the consent of the owner. This act provides protection for the following digital media:
- Audio
- Video
- Software
This law does not protect algorithms though. This means that anyone can use an especially go algorithm discovered by someone else, so long as they do not copy the code.
One further thing to note is that this law also compels users to comply with any licenses and licence agreements that come with the product or IP.

## Creative Commons / CC
The creative commons is an an organisation that grants licenses to pieces of IP that are placed within it. These pieces are considered 'copyright-free', and thus can be used freely, however, attribution may be required. Further licenses can be placed upon these works, restricting commercial use or redistribution and modification such as the GPL or MIT licences.

## Regulations of Investigatory Powers Act (2000)
This law provides a framework regulating how and what data the government may seek out and access. This includes the regulation of police investigations and undercover agents and informers (spies).
From this act, authorities have the power to:
- Access communications data of any ISP's customers in secret in the interest of national security, and for the purpose of detecting crimes and safeguarding the economic interests of the economy.
- Monitor people's communications and perform surveillance.
- May demand access to decryption keys and accessing protected information
- Prevent the existence of any interception warrants and the data collected from them from being exposed in a court of law.
